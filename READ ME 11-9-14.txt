NOTES 11/9/14

-WalletGUI, ProofOfWork, GenSig, VerSig, ZipFiles classes included in latest SpartaGold project.

-P2P still not implemented. Waiting on integration.

-To make transactions easier, ZipFiles creates "message.zip" that includes all 5 files: transaction, signature, publickey, ledger, userMap. Now only one file needs to be sent (sending files not yet implemented). ProofOfWork/GUI must extract (not yet implemented).

-GenSig properly generates public key and signature based on transaction input.

-VerSig properly verifies that transaction is valid.

-ProofOfWork was Ledger class, renamed. Processes proof of work, updates balances on userMap and ledger. Must listen for broadcasts to begin process (not yet implemented).
